# Exploring the Socio-economic Factors of Violent Crime in America

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the USA has drawn worldwide concern as their internal social 
tensions caused the country to become gravely violent and divided. The extent of this violence is
shown in The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo’s, comment, that: "more people are now
dying from gun violence and crime than [from] Covid” (Horton, 2021) As young adults in
Canada we are concerned about the developing situation in our neighbouring country. 

Furthermore, in history, Canada and the USA have a long-standing relationship of being reliant
on one another and now “the two countries stand as a modern example of interdependence and
cooperation” (English, 2020). Naturally, a predicted rise in violent crime in the USA will also
directly affect Canadians as we share one of the largest borders in the world, crossing over the
entire continent of North America. Cultures and social trends on the other side of the border flow
quickly into Canada through trade, travel, and the emergence of globalization through social
media.

Therefore, in this analysis we aim to fit the best model to account for the influence of a
variety of socioeconomic variables on violent crime rates in a community.

We have tried multiple ways to fit our data in order to achieve the bestperforming fitted model. 
The best model we found to predict violent crime rates within a community is


log(Violent Crimes per Population) = 14.28480 − 0.75325log(Median Family Income) −1.10032log(Percentage of Bachelors or More) + 0.28061log(Percentage Unemployed)
+ 0.12190log(Lemas Total Requests) − 0.71819log(Police Cars) + 0.28061log(Percentage of Bachelors or More) * log(Police Cars)

This model shows that a variety of socio-economic factors including income, education,
employment, and other factors like the number of police cars in a community, the number of
requests for police, and the interaction between the percentage of people with a bachelors degree
and police cars, do influence the number of violent crimes in a community.
